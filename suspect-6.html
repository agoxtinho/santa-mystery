  <div class="testimony">
    <p>
      I’m innocent. I didn’t kidnap Santa, and I definitely didn’t plan anything with anyone. I came early (around 7:30) because Santa and I are old friends, and I thought it would be a fun, low‑stress night.
<p>
My conflict with Santa: 
<p>
The lasagne. Santa served lasagne al ragù—my lasagne—and people started saying it was ‘even better than Hugo’s.’ I laughed it off at the table, but I was shocked. Later I saw a recipe card that looked suspiciously like my method. I felt betrayed… but being offended is not a crime.
<p>
When I noticed Santa was missing: 
<p>
Right before dessert, around midnight. The kitchen got quiet, then suddenly people were waiting. In those minutes I stepped out of the dining room to rinse a sauce stain and get water. I remember a corridor chime and then the beanie photo chaos—lots of laughing, phones up, people not watching the hallway.
<p>
Means?
<p>
I surf; I had a strap and tape in my bag like I always do, but that’s normal for me. If you want someone with ‘tools,’ look at Carola’s medical kit or anyone carrying cords and ties as ‘decorations.’
<p>
Who I suspect: 
<p>
Luca. He already had a legal dispute brewing about Santa’s working conditions, and he was disappearing from the table. If someone wanted Christmas to stop as leverage, that’s a motive.
